Great Words, Great Works Reading Program
Each year, the Scripps National Spelling Bee publishes our School Spelling Bee Study List to help students prepare for classroom and
school-level spelling bees. These words come from a list of books carefully selected by the Bee’s editorial team. That list of books is called
Great Words, Great Works. Find it at spellingbee.com/book-list.

A Big-Time Spellebrity
If you’ve watched the Bee before, you’ve probably seen his face. You’ve definitely heard his voice. We’re talking about the official
pronouncer of the Bee, Dr. Jacques Bailly. He won the Scripps National Spelling Bee in 1980 and
took up the role of pronouncer in 2003.
